        <h2 id="ourMonastery" class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">Our Monastery</span></h2>
        <p class="lead">Magistri Traditionis monastery is located in the heart of Alexandria, Ontario. As the name suggests, our monastery is
        dedicated to the preservation of Catholic tradition. In doing so, our monastery hosts week-long retreats for catholic
        priests interested in learning how to celebrate mass from the 1962 Roman Missal - the latest form of the traditional
        Latin mass.</p>

        <h3>The Monastery</h3>
        <p class="lead">Housing 33 monks, Magistri Traditionis monastery sits on the surrounding properties of St. Finnan Basilica. The
        monastery also has facilities for hosting groups of up to 12 priests at a time, metal-working garages, classrooms, and a
        beautiful garden.</p>
        <p class="lead">The founders of the monastery intentionally chose to be affiliated with St. Finnan's as the Basilica has three
        traditional altars (as can be seen in the second image in the slideshow above). Having these three altars was important
        because it meant that multiple traditional masses could be celebrated at a time. This is necessary when the monks are
        hosting retreats with a larger group of priests and need the extra altars for teaching them the Latin mass.</p>

         <h3>The Monks</h3>
        <p class="lead">All monks at Magistri Traditionis are priests ordained in the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter (FSSP). This is a
        requirement as FSSP priests are taught to celebrate the mass “according to the traditional Roman Rite”<sup>1</sup>.</p>

        <h3>Daily Life</h3>
        <b>Prayer</b>
        <p class="lead">On top of attending daily mass and praying lauds and vespers, monks at Magistri Traditionis must pray all twenty decades of the rosary
        every day. Starting with the joyful mysteries after lauds, then praying the sorrowful mysteries after lunch, followed by
        the glorious mysteries after vespers and finishing with the luminous mysteries before bed.</p>

        <b>Teaching</b>
        <p class="lead">Second to prayer, teaching is the next most important part of the monks' daily lives. Teaching at Magistri Traditionis
        is focused on the instruction of the traditional Latin mass. Such instruction is carried out in three different ways at
        the monastery:</p>
        <ol class="lead lead-li">
          <li><b>Workshops:</b> As mentioned, the monastery's primary activity involves hosting retreats for teaching priests to celebrate
          the extraordinary form of the mass. On such retreats, priests will attend workshops hosted by monks. Common workshops
          are: Latin Pronunciation, Gregorian Chant and Liturgical Norms.</li>
          <li><b>Writing:</b> Monks are also encouraged to advocate for the celebration of the traditional mass beyond the walls of the
          monastery. This can be accomplished by writing articles, books and even appearing on podcasts.</li>
          <li><b>Supporting:</b> This type of teaching involves answering letters and phone calls from priests about various intricacies
          pertaining to the celebration of the traditional mass.</li>
        </ol>

        <b>Work</b>
        <p class="lead">The use of incense is an important ingredient for the beauty and mystery of the mass, and an essential part of the
        traditional liturgy. Therefore, monks at Magistri Traditionis spend part of their time crafting thuribles - the vessels
        for holding and burning incense. In the spring and summertime, the production of thuribles slows down as the monks take
        on the responsibility of tending to the monastery's garden.</p>

        <h3>Motto</h3>
        <p class="lead">Imitating the motto of Benedictine orders, “ora et labora”<sup>2</sup> is the motto of Magistri Traditionis, meaning pray and
        work. It is believed that idleness is a sure path to sin, therefore the monks are encouraged to dive deeply into their
        work and prayer. In addition, St. Paul advises “to keep away from believers who are living in idleness” (2 Thes 3:6 -
        NRSV). As such, the monks are subject to dense daily working and prayer schedules. Here is a typical day for a monk:</p>
        <table id="schedule" class="table custom-table">
          <tr>
            <th>AM</th>
            <th>PM</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <ul>
                <li>7am - lauds, rosary, mass</li>
                <li>9am - breakfast</li>
                <li>10am - teach Latin workshop</li>
              </ul>
            </td>
            <td>
              <ul>
                <li>12pm - lunch, rosary</li>
                <li>1pm - teach Gregorian chant workshop</li>
                <li>3pm - help cook</li>
                <li>5pm - dinner</li>
                <li>6pm - vespers, rosary</li>
                <li>7pm - metal working</li>
                <li>10pm - last rosary</li>
              </ul>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <h3>Controversies</h3>
        <p class="lead">One of the main controversies at the Magistri Traditionis monastery is the praying of the Luminous mysteries of the
        rosary as a part of the mandatory daily rosary that needs to be prayed by every monk. This prayer is controversial among
        the monks as it was instituted by Pope John Paul II less than three decades ago in 2002 <sup>3</sup>. Given their fierce dedication
        to tradition, some of the monks at Magistri Traditionis are resistive to praying such a relatively novel prayer in
        relation to the history of the Church. In fact, since the Luminous mysteries are scheduled to be prayed privately before
        bed, it is rumoured that some of the monks rebel by praying the Glorious mysteries instead.</p>

      <div class="col-md-7 order-md-2">
        <h2 id="rule" class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">Rule</h2>
        <h3>Technology</h3>
        <p class="lead">Monks are forbidden from owning any personal digital device such as a smartphone or laptop. If monks require a device
        for work related matters they may use one of the computers in the library. Monks are also allowed to use the computers
        for spiritual research and writing. Monks are allowed to own MP3 players and use them for listening to music, but they
        must use headphones when doing so.</p>

        <h3>Mealtimes</h3>
        <p class="lead">Monks are to take turns cooking, serving, and doing dishes according to a schedule. In addition, as inspired by chapter
        38 in the rule of St. Benedict, there is to be a reader during mealtimes who will read spiritual texts the monks. During
        such times, there must be no talking among the monks, even for practical reasons “let the Brethren so minister to each
        other, that no one need ask for anything”<sup>4</sup>.</p>

        <h3>Recreation</h3>
        <p class="lead">Monks may only leave the monastery upon being granted permission by an elder. In general, monks should not leave the
        monastery more than once a month. Monks may have possessions that enable their recreation and hobbies, so long as they
        are not digital. For example, musical instruments, painting supplies, radios and carving supplies are allowed on site.
        Monks may smoke cigars and pipes indoors, so long as they are mindful of their ashes. Cigarettes must be smoked
        outdoors. Drinking is permitted.</p>

        <h2 id="penance" class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">Penance</h2>
        <p class="lead">The penitential at Magistri Tranditionis monastery is based on the seven deadly sins. As per paragraph 1434 in the
        Catechism of the Catholic Church, prayer, fasting, and almsgiving are considered to be the highest expressions of
        penance <sup>5</sup>. Thus, Magistri Tranditionis prioritizes such exercises for penance. Lastly, the following contains only a few
        examples of typical penances and is not an exhaustive list.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-7">

        </ul>

        <h3>Lust</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>If a monk hugs a woman for more than 5 seconds, he is to say three Hail Mary's plus one for every second he hugged her

          <li>If a monk kisses a woman on the lips, he is to pray a decade of the Rosary.</li>

          <li>If a monk smokes weed, he is to give $20 to the Church.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Avarice</h3><ul>

          <li>If a monk steals, he is to return what he stole and give $50 to the Church.</li>
          <li>If a monk protests his pay, he is to pray a decade of the Rosary.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Sloth</h3><ul>
